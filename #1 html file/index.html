    <p>In chemistry a chemical formula is a way of presenting information about the chemicals.<b>A chemical formula is not chemical name since it does not contain any words</b>. <I>Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures</I>.</P>
    <p>The  chemical formula for Aluminium Sulphate is Al<sup>3</sup>(SO<sup>4</sup>)<sup>3</sup>.The molecular formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>
    <P>The simples     types of chemical formula are called Empirical formula.</P>Which use Lettersand numbers indicating the numerical <hr/> proportion of atoms of each type.<strong>Chemical Formula</strong> can fullly specify the structure.Molecules and chemical substance are <em>More limited</em> in power then chemical names.<blockquote>A chemical formula tells us the numbers of atoms of each element in a compound.</blockquote><q>Sometimes a chemical formula is complicated</q></p>
